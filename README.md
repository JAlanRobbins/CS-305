SNHU Software Security


- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Our client, Artemis Financial, is a banking intermediary between their clients and other financial institutions, either within the country or across international borders, that processes transactions for their clients like buying or selling property or other assets. They wanted to address a way to ensure that all transactions that they make with their Web-Based API are secure and safe for both them and their clients.

- What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
What I believe that I handled well with our clients when finding vulnerabilities was diagnosing and reporting how they could improve their system and how our company can provide them with a more secure framework for their clients. It is important to code securely so that we do not create any more vulnerabilities for our clients or leave an even wider opening than when they asked for an assessment. Software Security promotes a companies wellbeing by protecting the companies assets and ensuring that they are not responsible for any attacks on their clients that would result in them having to reimburse their clients.

- What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I think that a problem that I struggle with when doing the vulnerability assessment is that I have not had a lot of practice with analyzing code. During my first analysis I thought that I had covered it very well but then when I received my grade, I missed key elements. I believe that I was not thorough going into separate code files and did not see key issues, I will try to acknowledge this and be more analytical in future cases.

- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by recommending multiple avenues to improve the overall security of the API while removing vulnerabilities already inherent in the system. I believe that in the future a good way to look for vulnerabilities in code is to use software and databases dedicated to finding vulnerabilities within code and possibly using future AI generated software that can find these vulnerabilities easier.

- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Running multiple passes of the code through the Eclipse Software and ensuring that the proper certificates were authenticated through the checksum ensured that it was both functional and secure. By looking at the dependencies of the program and re-evaluating the code, I made sure that I did not create any new vulnerabilities to my program.

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I think that checking dependencies to look for vulnerabilities through installed pug-ins is a very important tool that I will definitely seek to use in future programs where security is a concern.

- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Although I am not confident in my refactored code, I think that if I have anything that I am confident in this assignment, it would be my final report, I felt as if I explained my reasons for the vulnerabilities well and gave good examples of how our client could improve their system.
